Design Thinking

Empathize

The City of Chicago is building; we have to make sure this city has the best infrastructure and traffic system in world. The population is huge we have to make sure there are no jams in the intersections and people can travel from one point to another hassle free

Define

The main problem of Chicago intersection is that it should accompany all kind of people and vehicles to reach their homes/office safely on time.


Ideate

We are prioritizing the people with less safety on road (pedestrians) to highest heavy vehicles (trucks) on road.

•	Pedestrians and cyclers will have footpaths where they can move quickly and safely since there won’t be any blockage we can keep it as since the density of people pedestrians is less

•	We will use red signal for Pedestrians to cross the roads.

•	We can keep the traffic light red until the opposite road light is red.

•	We take help of face detection to make sure it senses people faces and don’t turn the light green until pedestrians crosses the road even if the timer is zero.

•	To make sure the light vehicles/two wheelers keep moving without any blockage, we will have a separate line along side of foot path we can name it as service road.

•	We can use main roads for 4 wheelers and other medium sized vehicles.

•	We can clear the traffic faster if we allow two lanes of people to move at a time when the traffic light turns to green.

•	We identified the peak hours of traffic is 08AM – 11AM and 06PM – 09PM. These are generally office hours. To make sure the safety and time in mind we will not allow heavy vehicles to travel in the peak hours.

•	Also, to make sure every follows traffic rules we use cameras on every intersection to detect the rule breaker and fine them.



Future Work

•	For future work we need to create flyovers for fast and heavy vehicles with a minimum speed in mind so that they can travel anytime with fewer intersections.

•	We can also change the traffic lights to yellow blinking from 11PM – 5AM when the traffic is very less. Vehicles can move continuously on these times.
